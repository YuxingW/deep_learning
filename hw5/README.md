Reference https://docs.google.com/presentation/d/1oYhObX2fgA3PCgVEkwalJR0usam0iuFqPFcfyaPCO9s/edit#slide=id.p.  (i provided hints/reference colabs for each of the below implementation  in the slide deck notes - please refer it) (Links to an external site.)

NYC taxi dataset competition. - Extra points for getting state of art 3.0 rmse accuracy - with innovative features engineering and processing

a) Implement a plain end2end tensorflow model pipeline with EDA and visualizations etc.,. for this problem - using wide and deep model DNN model and proper feature engineering and preprocessing (use colab i provided in slide as a reference but use your own creativity and improve the model appropriately) (colab 1 in the slides)

 

Ensure you train on all the data set (while eda done on 15k samples)

b) Implement the same (a) model using TFX interactivecontext pipeline in a colab  (see the slide deck which says colab 1.1 and especially notes ) - watch the videos in the notes for implementation help - do not copy paste. use your own creativity.

 

c) Implement the solution using pytorch 

 

d) implement the solution using xgboost 

 

(check slides for reference)

 

The EDA is needed only for (a) - not for b,c,d

 

Aim for state of art (kaggle competition top 50 accuracy)
