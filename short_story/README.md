DNN compression techniques are used to meet out the limited storage and processing capacity available at the resource constraint IoT devices.

# NETWORK PRUNING
The key idea is to remove unimportant components such as layers, filters, channels, connections.
It includes techniques:
* Channel pruning
* Filter pruning
* Connection pruning
* Layer pruning
# SPARSITY RREPRESENTATION
The sparsity in the representation of the DNN model is exploited to reduce both storage and processing requirement of the DNN model.
It includes techniques:
* Quantization
* Multiplexing
* Weight sharing
# BITS PRECISION
In bits precision, the number of bits required for representing weight matrices is suppressed for reducing the storage and computation.
It includes techniques:
* Estimation using integer
* Low bits representation
# KNOWLEDGE DISTILLATION
* Logits transfer
* Teacher assistant
* Domain adaptation
