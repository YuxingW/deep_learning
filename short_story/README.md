As the demand for IoT based applications is proliferating, which enables data scientists to incorporate DNN models in IoT, the authors have done this survey to provide an overview of the DNN compression technique that can meet out the limited storage and processing capacity available at the resource constraint IoT devices.

# NETWORK PRUNING

The key idea is to remove unimportant components such as layers, filters, channels, connections.

## Channel pruning

## Filter pruning

## Connection pruning

## Layer pruning

# SPARSITY RREPRESENTATION
The sparsity in the representation of the DNN model is exploited to reduce both storage and processing requirement of the DNN model.

## Quantization

## Multiplexing

## Weight sharing

# BITS PRECISION

In bits precision, the number of bits required for representing weight matrices is suppressed for reducing the storage and computation.

## Estimation using integer

## Low bits representation

# KNOWLEDGE DISTILLATION

## Logits transfer

## Teacher assistant

## Domain adaptation
