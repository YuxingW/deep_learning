Write colab for illustrating use of SOTA (state of the art)  model architectures of fast ai - using cnn_learner for image classification, unet_learner for segmentation, text_classifier_learner for sentiment analysis, tabular_learner for decisiontree, collab_learner for ranking, - Try to do something different from what is done in the fastai colab (like classify dogs instead of cats, pick some other data set for segmentation etc.,.) - Try to do good inferencing examples as well.

Hints : look into Fast AI colab - https://github.com/fastai/fastbook/blob/master/01_intro.ipynb (Links to an external site.)  - to run this, the first cell of colab one execution gives a link to accounts.google.com and stops execution . you click on it copy the string and paste it in the text field. then it will proceed.

 

Part 2 : Whitebox deep learning - Read and perform the codelab https://codelabs.developers.google.com/codelabs/cloud-tensorflow-mnist#0

and checkin the output of the colab into github and publish the url as deliverable.   (Links to an external site.)
Submit thru github all the deliverables

Everything should be published in github with proper readme - with proper access control for me to grade. Please ensure all assets are there (run of the colab properly shown)

 

Github URL should be provided in the homework. Create two seperate directories. Submit the parent director url for the two directories.
